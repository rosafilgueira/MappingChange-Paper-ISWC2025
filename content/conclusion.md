## Conclusion

*Mapping Change* creates a temporal, semantic infrastructure for exploring Scottish place descriptions from 1803â€“1901. Combining LLM-based extraction, improved ontology design, and semantic search, we deliver a reusable, interoperable dataset for historical research.

The improved HTO ontology enables robust modeling of textual provenance, record quality, and evolving concepts. The Frances platform empowers researchers to query and visualize this data across time and space.

Future work includes integrating cartographic metadata, and link it to the 100 years of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
