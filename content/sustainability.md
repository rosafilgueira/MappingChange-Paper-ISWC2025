## Sustainability

Mapping Change is designed to support long-term historical research:

- **Archiving**: All code, data, and RDF outputs are versioned and archived on Zenodo.
- **Ontological Reuse**: The HTO ontology is maintained and extended in an open repository with permanent identifiers.
- **Frances Platform Integration**: The data is accessible through a production-ready semantic platform, ensuring ongoing usability beyond the scope of the project.
- **Extensibility**: The pipeline is modular and supports the integration of new volumes, editions, or other regional gazetteers.
