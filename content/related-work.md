A growing body of research in digital humanities and cultural heritage has increasingly adopted Semantic Web technologies to structure, enrich, and interlink historical textual corpora. Notable examples include [WarSampo](cite:cites WarSampo), which models World War II data from Finland as Linked Open Data, and [Enslaved.org](cites:cite enslaved, enslavedontology), which applies graph-based modeling to records from the transatlantic slave trade. These projects demonstrate how knowledge graphs can be used to represent complex relationships among people, places, and events in heterogeneous historical sources.

Initiatives such as the Europeana Data Model [EDM](cite:cites EDM) and the National Library of Scotland's [Data Foundry](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/) exemplify large-scale digitization and metadata modeling efforts aimed at improving accessibility and reuse of cultural heritage data. Europeana promotes interoperability through linked data principles and vocabulary standardization, while the NLS provides high-quality scans and [ALTO XML](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ALTO+XML&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and [METS XML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/) for thousands of 19th-century documents, including the [Gazetteers of Scotland](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/gazetteers-of-scotland/). However, these infrastructures alone are insufficient for corpora like Scottish gazetteers, which present significant challenges: noisy OCR, lack of article-level segmentation, mid-page article starts, and inconsistent editorial conventions across editions. Traditional approaches to structuring such texts—including rule-based or statistical methods—often fail under these conditions. Prior work on historical textual collections, such as newspapers or the Encyclopaedia Britannica (e.g., using the `defoe` [library](cite:cites extending-defoe)) has demonstrated the need for scalable, domain-adapted pipelines.

Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) such as [GPT-4](cite:cites gpt4_technical_report) open new possibilities for flexible text interpretation and segmentation. Our project leverages these models at scale with custom prompts tailored to the editorial style of each edition. This enables us to segment and extract over 50,000 structured article-level entries from ten 19th-century gazetteer volumes, while handling abbreviation styles, redirects, and evolving toponym usage.

Beyond extraction, semantic modeling is critical to ensuring data reusability and interpretability. We build on and extend prior ontologies developed for cultural heritage contexts—such as the [Encyclopaedia Britannica Ontology](cite:cites ebontology) and the [National Library of Scotland Ontology](cite:cites nlsontology)—to model bibliographic provenance and source structure. However, these earlier ontologies were not designed to represent the full diachronic and computational transformation history of digitized corpora. To address this gap, we introduced in our previous [work](cite:cites frances) the [Heritage Textual Ontology](https://w3id.org/hto) ([HTO](cite:cites hto)), which provides a provenance-aware semantic framework that models not only the source structure and bibliographic metadata, but also digitization context, Name Entity Recognition (NER)-based outputs, and semantic enrichments. HTO integrates concepts from [PROV-O](cite:cites groth2013prov) and [Schema.org](https://schema.org), but extends them with domain-specific classes and properties tailored to heritage corpora, supporting integration of various data sources from the same corpora.

Finally, this work is fully integrated into the [Frances](cite:cites frances) semantic platform, which supports temporal exploration and semantic search of historical data. Recent updates to Frances, include improved support for concept clustering, knowledge graph visualization, and extensible RDF modeling, making MappingChange a robust and reusable infrastructure for temporal knowledge base construction in historical research.
