## Abstract

We present *Mapping Change*, a temporal and semantic knowledge graph derived from ten 19th-century Gazetteers of Scotland (1803â€“1901). This resource semantically enriches over 50,000 digitized place descriptions using GPT-4-based information extraction, custom prompt engineering tailored to each gazetteer edition, entity disambiguation, and ontology-driven modeling. A key innovation lies in adapting large language models and heuristics to heterogeneous formats across nearly a century of OCR-scanned texts.

The resulting knowledge is structured using the updated [Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO)](https://w3id.org/hto), serialized as RDF, and linked to external sources including [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) and [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org). Enhanced [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co) indices support both full-text and semantic search across editions. The resource integrates into the [Frances](http://www.frances-ai.com) semantic platform, enabling historical, geographical, and linguistic analysis via SPARQL queries, interactive visualizations, and concept timelines. All code is available at [github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange).
