## Abstract

We present **[MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)**, a project that generates a temporal and semantic knowledge graph, **[GazetteersScotland-KG](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)**, derived from ten 19th-century **Gazetteers of Scotland** (1803â€“1901), digitized by the **[National Library of Scotland (NLS)](https://www.nls.uk/)**. The original dataset consists of over 13,000 page-level **ALTO XML** files produced via OCR, which lack explicit article-level segmentation. To transform this unsegmented, noisy data into structured place-based records, we leverage **large language models (LLMs)** to detect individual place-name entries and their corresponding descriptions. Given the distinct layouts and editorial conventions of each gazetteer edition (e.g., varying header formats, abbreviations, and multi-page entries), we adapt our techniques through tailored **[prompting strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering)** and post-processing heuristics.

The resulting **[GazetteersScotland-KG](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)** is structured using the updated **[Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO)](https://w3id.org/hto)**, serialized as **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)**, and enriched with semantic layers such as **entity disambiguation**, **temporal linking**, and **concept evolution**. **Embeddings** are used to link related place descriptions across editions, providing further depth to the graph. We integrate external knowledge from sources like **[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org)** and **[DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org)** to enhance the contextual understanding of place names. The project also produces additional resources, including structured **[DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)** and **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)** indices, which enable both full-text and semantic search across editions, facilitating deeper, more nuanced analysis.

These resources are integrated into the **[Frances](http://www.frances-ai.com)** semantic platform, allowing historical, geographical, and linguistic analysis via **[SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/)** queries, interactive visualizations, and concept timelines. All code and data are available at **[github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)**. This project supports reproducible research in **historical geography**, **digital heritage**, and **semantic enrichment**.
