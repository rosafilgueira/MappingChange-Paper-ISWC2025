## Abstract

We present **[MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)**, a resource that constructs a temporal and semantic knowledge base from ten 19th-century **[Gazetteers of Scotland](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections/gazetteers-of-scotland/)** (1803–1901), digitized as over 13,000 page-level **ALTO XML** files. These texts are noisy, inconsistently structured, and lack article-level markup—posing substantial challenges for reuse. To segment and extract over 50,000 historical place descriptions, we employ **large language models (LLMs)** with **edition-specific prompt strategies**, tuned to handle diverse editorial conventions, abbreviations, recurring place names, and multi-page entries. The resulting knowledge base comprises three interlinked knowledge graphs: (1) a **basic KG**, representing extracted article-level entries and their metadata; (2) a **concept-enriched KG**, clustering semantically related descriptions across editions using **sentence embeddings**, with links to **Wikidata** and **DBpedia**; and (3) a **location-annotated KG**, enriched through **named entity recognition** and **georesolution**. All graphs are expressed in **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)** and modeled using the extended **[Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO)](https://w3id.org/hto)**, which captures textual provenance, extraction context, and diachronic alignment. In addition to the knowledge graphs, we release (a) edition-specific and aggregated DataFrames (one row per place entry, including metadata and embeddings), and (b) a set of Jupyter Notebooks illustrating usage of our resource. All components are openly available and deployed through the [Frances](http://www.frances-ai.com) semantic platform and a public [Fuseki endpoint](http://query.frances-ai.com/hto_gazetteers), enabling historical exploration via semantic search, timeline comparison, and visual querying interfaces.
