## Abstract

We present **[MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)**, a project that constructs a temporal and semantic knowledge base from ten 19th-century **[Gazetteers of Scotland](https://www.nls.uk/)** (1803â€“1901), digitized as over 13,000 page-level **XML** files. These noisy, unstructured texts lack article-level markup and exhibit highly heterogeneous layouts. To segment and structure over 50,000 historical place descriptions, we employ **large language models (LLMs)** with **edition-specific prompting strategies**, tuned to handle distinct editorial conventions, abbreviations, and multi-page entries. The resulting **[GazetteersScotland-KG](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange)** comprises three interlinked knowledge graphs: (1) a **basic KG**, extracted from cleaned DataFrames; (2) a **concept-enriched KG**, linking semantically similar place records across editions using **sentence embeddings**, **Wikidata**, and **DBpedia**; and (3) a **location-annotated KG**, enriched with **named entity recognition** and **geographic disambiguation**. All are expressed in **[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)** and modeled with the updated **[Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO)](https://w3id.org/hto)**, which captures textual provenance, prompt metadata, record lineage, and concept evolution.
