## Introduction

Descriptive gazetteers were central to how 19th-century Scotland documented its geography—towns, parishes, rivers, castles, lochs, and glens—embedding each place within broader historical, economic, and social narratives. These texts evolved over the century, reflecting transformations brought about by industrialization, land reform, public health, and imperial expansion. The *Gazetteers of Scotland, 1803–1901*, digitized by the [National Library of Scotland (NLS)](https://data.nls.uk/data/digitised-collections), constitute one of the most comprehensive corpora for studying Scotland’s spatial knowledge in the long 19th century. The full collection comprises twenty volumes produced by different publishers and editors, and has been released as more than 13,000 high-resolution scans accompanied by [ALTO XML](https://www.loc.gov/standards/alto/) files. These XML files encode layout and textual content extracted via Optical Character Recognition (OCR), resulting in over 1.75 million lines and 14 million words. While this makes the data technically accessible, it remains largely unsuitable for structured analysis: the texts lack article-level markup, exhibit inconsistent typographic structures, and contain significant OCR noise. Entries often begin mid-column, span multiple pages, and vary widely in format and editorial style—posing major challenges for computational processing, information retrieval, and historical reuse.

Compounding these challenges is the fact that many place names (e.g., “ABBEY” or “GREENHILL”) recur across the gazetteers, often referring to different locations. Disambiguating such entries is non-trivial, as it depends on contextual clues within each article rather than surface-level patterns. Our approach relies on LLM-based article segmentation and interpretation—capturing subtle editorial cues and semantic context to correctly associate each name with the appropriate description.

*MappingChange* is the first project to construct a structured, queryable, and semantically enriched temporal knowledge base from this entire collection. We extract and align over 50,000 historical place descriptions across ten gazetteer editions, using large language models (LLMs) and volume-specific prompting strategies that are carefully tuned to editorial idiosyncrasies. The result is a knowledge base composed of three interlinked knowledge graphs: a basic graph derived from structured DataFrames; a concept-enriched graph linking semantically similar entries across editions using sentence embeddings, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), and [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org); and a location-annotated graph generated through geotagging and georesolving techniques. These graphs are serialized in [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) and modeled using the [Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO)](https://w3id.org/hto), a domain ontology we developed specifically for historical and heritage corpora.


The complexity and variability of these sources can be seen in Figure 1, which presents the opening pages of two editions: the 1803 *Gazetteer of Scotland* and the 1884 *Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland*. These differences, compounded across volumes, necessitate a custom approach to segmentation, prompting, and post-processing—especially since no edition includes machine-readable metadata or reliable article delimiters. Note that articles can span multiple pages, but there is no page-level indication of article continuation.

Place names appear in all caps, typically followed by a period or semicolon—offering minimal typographic separation between entries.

This edition presents clearer structure, with entries formatted in title case and followed by commas. Page headers consit of the first and last name page's places, both in uppercase. Furthermore, it introduces long articles with historical digressions and cross-references necessitating more refined prompting strategies for segmentation.

Of the twenty volumes in the NLS dataset, we process ten as fully descriptive gazetteers with complete metadata and dual-volume structure. We exclude the 1828 edition, which is a town-focused summary rather than a gazetteer, and the 1848 edition, for which only Volume II survives. All ten processed volumes are mapped into structured DataFrames, knowledge graphs, and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) indices that enable full-text and vector-based semantic search. These resources are deployed via the [Frances](http://www.frances-ai.com) semantic web platform, allowing users to explore the evolution of Scottish place descriptions through [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/) queries, concept timelines, and geolinguistic visualizations. All code and data are openly available at [github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange).

This work offers a reusable digital resource that transforms a historically important but structurally inaccessible corpus into a machine-readable knowledge base for temporal, geographical, and linguistic analysis—paving the way for new forms of linked data research in cultural heritage and historical geography.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews related work on gazetteer digitization, knowledge base construction, and the use of language models for historical document processing. Section 3 introduces the Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO), including its conceptual model and alignment with other semantic vocabularies. Section 4 details the end-to-end *MappingChange* pipeline, from OCR ingestion and LLM-based segmentation to DataFrame creation and RDF serialization. Section 5 presents the construction of the three interlinked knowledge graphs and their semantic enrichment through embeddings, entity linking, and location annotation. Section 6 describes the integration of all outputs into the Frances semantic platform, highlighting search, querying, and visual exploration capabilities. Section 7 provides qualitative examples and a usage scenario illustrating how the knowledge base supports temporal and comparative analysis of Scottish place descriptions. Section 8 concludes with a summary of contributions and discusses directions for future work.
