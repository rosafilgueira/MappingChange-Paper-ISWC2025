## Resource Description
{:#resourcedescription}

The MappingChange resource provides a reusable, modular knowledge base that transforms the digitized [Gazetteers of Scotland](https://data.nls.uk/data/metadata-collections/gazetteers-of-scotland/) (1803–1901) into a structured and semantically enriched dataset for historical place-based analysis. Central to the resource are volume-specific JSON DataFrames containing over 50,000 articles—each corresponding to a place entry—extracted from OCR-aligned ALTO XML using edition-specific GPT-4 prompts. These DataFrames include article text, identified place names, and structured metadata such as edition, volume, page number, and word count. They serve as the foundation for the construction of three interlinked RDF knowledge graphs, modeled using the [Heritage Textual Ontology (HTO)](https://w3id.org/hto), which captures both textual provenance and semantic transformations.

The first knowledge graph encodes cleaned article-level records and their bibliographic context, preserving references to their original digitized pages. The second graph introduces concept-level alignment by clustering semantically equivalent entries across editions, assigning persistent identifiers and linking them to external entities such as [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) and [DBpedia](https://www.dbpedia.org). The third graph adds geographic enrichment, using named entity recognition and georesolution techniques to annotate articles with location coordinates and spatial types. Together, these layers enable advanced temporal and semantic analysis of how places were described over time in the Scottish Gazetteers.

All knowledge graphs are serialized in RDF/Turtle and adhere to FAIR data principles. Outputs are hosted in a public Fuseki SPARQL endpoint and are complemented by a set of Elasticsearch indices that support both traditional keyword search and vector-based semantic similarity queries. These indices cover articles, concepts, and external entity links, enabling fast and flexible retrieval across editions and enrichment layers. All components are deployed within the [Frances](http://www.frances-ai.com) semantic platform, providing users with interactive interfaces for querying, timeline visualization, and concept exploration.

he full resource—including DataFrames, RDF files, and search indices—is openly available at [https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange](https://github.com/francesNLP/MappingChange), with persistent identifiers to be issued via Zenodo. The [HTO ontology](https://w3id.org/hto) is developed in an open repository under a CC-BY 4.0 license. To promote reuse and reproducibility, the repository includes modular scripts and comprehensive documentation. The step-by-step process by which these resources are constructed—including article extraction, prompt design, semantic clustering, and enrichment—is detailed in [Section 5](#resourceconstruction).
