Our evaluation focuses on extraction accuracy, semantic enrichment, and user-facing search and exploration capabilities:

- **Extraction Accuracy**: Manual inspection of GPT-4 outputs across editions shows over 90% correct segmentation and labeling, significantly outperforming rule-based heuristics.
- **Deduplication and Clustering**: Concept timelines group term variants across editions with high precision, as confirmed through Colab-based inspections.

Quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback are detailed in supplementary materials and the Colab notebook.
